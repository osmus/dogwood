# [Dogwood](https://github.com/osmus/dogwood)

Dogwood is the [theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator powering [openstreetmap.us](https://openstreetmap.us). While the content for the OpenStreetMap US website is kept internal to the organization, we've decided to open source the site's theme for the benefit of the community.

Dogwood pushes the envelope of what's possible with static site generators. It supports complex sites with thousands of interconnected, customizable pages, each with their own requirements. For example, you can make a page for a person that links to and from posts they've written, event they've spoken at, and projects they're a part of.

Dogwood is under active development and is not currently versioned. Breaking changes may occur without notice, so we recommend targeting a specific commit of the project of simply forking it.

The Dogwood theme is named for Virginia's state flower, since the OpenStreetMap US [website redesign](https://openstreetmap.us/news/2023/06/website-redesign/) was announced onstage at [State of the Map US 2023](https://openstreetmap.us/events/state-of-the-map-us/2023) in Richmond, Virginia.

## Installation

Dogwood is not distributed as a Ruby gem at this time. However, can still use Dogwood as a theme for your Jekyll site.

Open your terminal and `cd` into the repo's directory. Add Dogwood as a submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/osmus/dogwood.git
```

This will clone the theme repo into a `dogwood` folder and also add a .gitmodules file:

```
[submodule "dogwood"]
	path = dogwood
	url = https://github.com/osmus/dogwood.git
```

Next, add these lines to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# theme
gem "osmus-dogwood", path: "dogwood"

# theme plugins
gem "absolute-urls", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/absolute-urls"
gem "manual-markdown", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/manual-markdown"
gem "post-aliases", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/post-aliases"
gem "unwrap-img", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/unwrap-img"
```

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: osmus-dogwood
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

If you're already running your dev server you'll need to manually restart it for the config changes to take effect.

## Site structure

Dogwood expects your site to have four types of content, each with its own directory:

- `/_pages`: basic pages
- `/_people`: profile pages for people
- `/_posts`: pages with date and author information
- `/_redirects`: simple redirects to other pages

Jekyll will only process directories starting with underscores if you output them like this in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
collections:
  pages:
    output: true
  people:
    output: true
  posts:
    output: true
  redirects:
    output: true
```

It's helpful to set the default layout for these pages. You can set other default values here if you want, like permalinks:

```yaml
defaults:
  - scope:
      type: "pages"
    values:
      layout: "page"
  - scope:
      type: "people"
    values:
      layout: "person"
  - scope:
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "post"
      permalink: /blog/:year/:month/:title/ # or whatever
  - scope:
      type: "redirects"
    values:
      layout: "redirect"
```

Each type of content has its own set of Jekyll front matter values you can customize. Documentation for supported values can be found on these pages:

- [page](https://github.com/osmus/dogwood/blob/gh-pages/docs/page.md)
- [person](https://github.com/osmus/dogwood/blob/gh-pages/docs/person.md)
- [post](https://github.com/osmus/dogwood/blob/gh-pages/docs/post.md)
- [redirect](https://github.com/osmus/dogwood/blob/gh-pages/docs/redirect.md)

Inspired today by *Dogwood Blossoms* by George Marion McClellan from *The Book of American Negro Poetry* (1922). This poem is in the public domain.

To dreamy languors and the violet mist<br/>
   Of early Spring, the deep sequestered vale<br/>
Gives first her paling-blue Miamimist,<br/>
    Where blithely pours the cuckoo’s annual tale<br/>
Of Summer promises and tender green,<br/>
    Of a new life and beauty yet unseen.<br/>
The forest trees have yet a sighing mouth,<br/>
    Where dying winds of March their branches swing,<br/>
While upward from the dreamy, sunny South,<br/>
    A hand invisible leads on the Spring.<br/>

His rounds from bloom to bloom the bee begins<br/>
    With flying song, and cowslip wine he sups,<br/>
Where to the warm and passing southern winds,<br/>
    Azaleas gently swing their yellow cups.<br/>
Soon everywhere, with glory through and through,<br/>
    The fields will spread with every brilliant hue.<br/>
But high o’er all the early floral train,<br/>
    Where softness all the arching sky resumes,<br/>
The dogwood dancing to the winds’ refrain,<br/>
    In stainless glory spreads its snowy blooms.

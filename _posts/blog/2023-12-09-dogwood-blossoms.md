Inspired today by *Dogwood Blossoms* by George Marion McClellan. This 1922 poem is in the public domain.

To dreamy languors and the violet mist<br>
   Of early Spring, the deep sequestered vale<br>
Gives first her paling-blue Miamimist,<br>
    Where blithely pours the cuckoo’s annual tale<br>
Of Summer promises and tender green,<br>
    Of a new life and beauty yet unseen.<br>
The forest trees have yet a sighing mouth,<br>
    Where dying winds of March their branches swing,<br>
While upward from the dreamy, sunny South,<br>
    A hand invisible leads on the Spring.<br>

His rounds from bloom to bloom the bee begins<br>
    With flying song, and cowslip wine he sups,<br>
Where to the warm and passing southern winds,<br>
    Azaleas gently swing their yellow cups.<br>
Soon everywhere, with glory through and through,<br>
    The fields will spread with every brilliant hue.<br>
But high o’er all the early floral train,<br>
    Where softness all the arching sky resumes,<br>
The dogwood dancing to the winds’ refrain,<br>
    In stainless glory spreads its snowy blooms.
